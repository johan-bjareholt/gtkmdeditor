gtkmdeditor
===========

A GTK libraries that supplies two widgets
- gtkmdeditor
- gtkmdviewer (WIP)

These widgets are not intending to support full support for Markdown/Commonmark, but rather just intended to support the basics such as titles, bold, italics, lists, links and pictures and not fancy things like tables or HTML.

Originally written for the application simple-diary-gtk, but should be fine for other use-cases as well.
