# Markdown Test Document

## Formatting

This is a **bold** text and this is *italic*.
You can also use __bold__ and _italic_ with underscores.

### Links

Here's a [link to Google](https://google.com)
here's a test image ![test image](testimage.jpg)

### Image/Picture

And here's an image: ![test image](testimage.jpg)

Multiple pictures in a row should also look nice, so here they come:
![test image_1](testimage.jpg)
![test image_2](testimage.jpg)
![test image_3](testimage.jpg)

#### Lists and More
